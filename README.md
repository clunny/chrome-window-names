# chrome-window-names
A Chrome extension to set custom labels for each chrome window

# What does it do?
Allows a user to set a custom name/label for a Chrome browser window.  So if a user has two windows open, they can name one 'work' and the other one 'personal' and there can be any number of windows with any custom name.  This should allow users to better organise their 'workspaces' in Chrome.
